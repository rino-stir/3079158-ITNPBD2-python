Otherwise Id give it only 1 star based on lack of longevity. It is so shiny and sparkly, but it flakes off in very large pieces after less than a day of wearing. The photo was taken just a few hours after finishing my nails and I didnt do anything strenuous that would excuse my nails chipping so quickly, but all of the polish on my index finger was gone, and most of my thumb as well. I always use base and top coat and manicures usually last me a week, sometimes more with minimal chipping and wear. I was very disappointed with how easily it chips off compared to other brands.

They are made of nice thick cotton with a white backing. They also lay nicely. I am replacing JCP Savannah roman shades with these JCP thermal ones because the Savannah shades have not held up well in my bathroom. (See my review under Savannah shades with photo explaining why). Also, Savannah shades are light filtering where as the thermal shades are nearly blackout. What I dont like about these thermal shades is that the brackets are made of cheap plastic and the screws are cheap so be sure to at least use some quality screws.

In the meantime, as I am complaining to family and friends about the lengthy brew time, they informed me, three of them, that the K2.0 200 worked like a charm and delivered coffee quickly! As I called again about the horrible performance of the K2.0 300, Keurig graciously offered to upgrade to the more expensive model. I immediately said No, just send me the cheaper one, the K2.0 200, because I know this one has a good track record. This model works the best! Believe me!!! Fast brewing (50 seconds), hot, and you can use your own coffee pod to brew your own brand without using the expensive Kcups, if that is what you want to do!!

I have soaked all removable parts (water reservoir, k-cup holder, etc) in white vineagar over night, spent an hour running white vinegar and water cleanses through the machine, and I even washed all the removable parts in the dishwasher (something youre not supposed to do but it was my last resort). Nothing I do removes the plastic taste and smell. Everything I try to brew is undrinkable. Reading the reviews from other 2.0 owners, I see I am not the only one drinking coffee that tastes like a burnt barbie doll. I have been a loyal customer for years, and even recruited my parents to the brand (my mom owns a coffee shop so this was quiet a feat), but I am now fearful of the plastic being used in the new 2.0 brewers.

Two weeks later one pair showed up with a hole towards the bottom of the jeans. By October, 2 more pair of jeans had holes in the knees. I am so disappointed. I have found at least two other brands that charge less money for their jeans and that last at least 6 months to a year before the knees give out.

Four covered a 70 inch window very well and I have them stacking against the wall in order to get the full light. They are not bulky and hang well. Note to manufacturers: I am irritated with all the manufacturers who refuse to accommodate a 90 inch length option. Since the style for some time has been to hang curtains as high to the ceiling as possible, average window length is too short, and 95 is too long.

These are the perfect Ankle Boot to wear with the Kilt, espc. if you are on a budget and cannot afford the pricey sorts. These Hi-Lows have a leather uppers, & a one piece sole with a non skid section. They cannot be resoled nor reheeled; so buy some heel plates to get more life from the Hi-Lows. The height is right for kilt wearing with the standard hose. They give good ankle support & keep the gravel out of your shoes! The brogue-ing is quite good, and overall construction is very good. They take a good shine, & will work for both Casual & Dress Kilt wearing occasions. The style is a good copy of the Edwardian mans shoe, this is the Era in which the kilt and its components took their present life and style. Thus it is the Right Style of Male Footwear to wear with the Kilt. I liked them well enough to order another pair in Black, again. I had wanted the Brown, but it is out of stocklikely forever And yes, I HAVE recommended these to many friends; via a Kilt wearing Forum. For the trowser wearing men, these should look suitable half covered by the trowsers cuff, but then you hide most of the footwear, and its style. On 2nd thought, stay with the Oxford/low cut shoes when you wear trowsers!

Lined with glove leather is an especially nice touch. Made in Bangladesh, so it is not your usual Chinese product which is hit or miss. Bangladesh is adjacent to India, so the craftsmanship is much better. I always treat my boots with 50-50 boiled linseed oil and beeswax to preserve them and waterproof them. Noticed the leather although soft and supple absorbed this process and it took 6 treatments to finally seal them. Not a problem, but my process does darken the leather, which does not bother me as it protects my feet. Suspect that they must not oil these boots while they are in production, so if you buy them, you may want to use my treatment or simply put on the available mink oil, although that will darken the leather somewhat too.

These are the perfect Ankle Boot to wear with the Kilt, espc. if you are on a budget and cannot afford the pricey sorts. These Hi-Lows have a leather uppers, & a one piece sole with a non skid section. They cannot be resoled nor reheeled; so buy some heel plates to get more life from the Hi-Lows. The height is right for kilt wearing with the standard hose. They give good ankle support & keep the gravel out of your shoes! The brogue-ing is quite good, and overall construction is very good. They take a good shine, & will work for both Casual & Dress Kilt wearing occasions. The style is a good copy of the Edwardian mans shoe, this is the Era in which the kilt and its components took their present life and style. Thus it is the Right Style of Male Footwear to wear with the Kilt. I liked them well enough to order another pair in Black, again. I had wanted the Brown, but it is out of stocklikely forever And yes, I HAVE recommended these to many friends; via a Kilt wearing Forum. For the trowser wearing men, these should look suitable half covered by the trowsers cuff, but then you hide most of the footwear, and its style. On 2nd thought, stay with the Oxford/low cut shoes when you wear trowsers!

Lined with glove leather is an especially nice touch. Made in Bangladesh, so it is not your usual Chinese product which is hit or miss.

Noticed the leather although soft and supple absorbed this process and it took 6 treatments to finally seal them. Not a problem, but my process does darken the leather, which does not bother me as it protects my feet. Suspect that they must not oil these boots while they are in production, so if you buy them, you may want to use my treatment or simply put on the available mink oil, although that will darken the leather somewhat too.

Thus it is the Right Style of Male Footwear to wear with the Kilt. I liked them well enough to order another pair in Black, again. I had wanted the Brown, but it is out of stocklikely forever And yes, I HAVE recommended these to many friends; via a Kilt wearing Forum. For the trowser wearing men, these should look suitable half covered by the trowsers cuff, but then you hide most of the footwear, and its style. On 2nd thought, stay with the Oxford/low cut shoes when you wear trowsers! In sum; a very good pair of Hi-Lows for the price.', 'Score': 2, 'user_data': {'dob': '1980-07-31 00:00:00', 'state': 'Alabama', 'age': 38, 'statecode': 'AL'}}, {'User': 'vvxe4433', 'Review': 'For your money, Id say this is great value.

Lined with glove leather is an especially nice touch. Made in Bangladesh, so it is not your usual Chinese product which is hit or miss. Bangladesh is adjacent to India, so the craftsmanship is much better. I always treat my boots with 50-50 boiled linseed oil and beeswax to preserve them and waterproof them. Noticed the leather although soft and supple absorbed this process and it took 6 treatments to finally seal them. Not a problem, but my process does darken the leather, which does not bother me as it protects my feet. Suspect that they must not oil these boots while they are in production, so if you buy them, you may want to use my treatment or simply put on the available mink oil, although that will darken the leather somewhat too. Other than that, an excellent buy and a very reasonable price too.

I am concerned because the newer model has more plastic in its front, top and side construction than its predecessor, which had more stainless steel. And, when you close the door, it feels more lightweight and less solid as its predecessor. But, it seems to measure up, feature wise. There are a few more choices, such as Soften for butter. And, the fan will now go on automatically if too much heat is generated by the stove top beneath. Because of a design change re: the fan (the previous one opened up to release the air; this one has vents in the stationary top), it had to project a bit more forward in the cabinetry, which involved installing it with a sham behind it to push it forward more. There is a monogram on the oven that is not flush, but sticks out.

These are the perfect Ankle Boot to wear with the Kilt, espc. if you are on a budget and cannot afford the pricey sorts. These Hi-Lows have a leather uppers, & a one piece sole with a non skid section. They cannot be resoled nor reheeled; so buy some heel plates to get more life from the Hi-Lows. The height is right for kilt wearing with the standard hose. They give good ankle support & keep the gravel out of your shoes! The brogue-ing is quite good, and overall construction is very good. They take a good shine, & will work for both Casual & Dress Kilt wearing occasions. The style is a good copy of the Edwardian mans shoe, this is the Era in which the kilt and its components took their present life and style. Thus it is the Right Style of Male Footwear to wear with the Kilt. I liked them well enough to order another pair in Black, again. I had wanted the Brown, but it is out of stocklikely forever And yes, I HAVE recommended these to many friends; via a Kilt wearing Forum. For the trowser wearing men, these should look suitable half covered by the trowsers cuff, but then you hide most of the footwear, and its style. On 2nd thought, stay with the Oxford/low cut shoes when you wear trowsers!

Lined with glove leather is an especially nice touch. Made in Bangladesh, so it is not your usual Chinese product which is hit or miss. Bangladesh is adjacent to India, so the craftsmanship is much better. I always treat my boots with 50-50 boiled linseed oil and beeswax to preserve them and waterproof them. Noticed the leather although soft and supple absorbed this process and it took 6 treatments to finally seal them. Not a problem, but my process does darken the leather, which does not bother me as it protects my feet. Suspect that they must not oil these boots while they are in production, so if you buy them, you may want to use my treatment or simply put on the available mink oil, although that will darken the leather somewhat too.

These are the perfect Ankle Boot to wear with the Kilt, espc. if you are on a budget and cannot afford the pricey sorts. These Hi-Lows have a leather uppers, & a one piece sole with a non skid section. They cannot be resoled nor reheeled; so buy some heel plates to get more life from the Hi-Lows. The height is right for kilt wearing with the standard hose. They give good ankle support & keep the gravel out of your shoes! The brogue-ing is quite good, and overall construction is very good. They take a good shine, & will work for both Casual & Dress Kilt wearing occasions. The style is a good copy of the Edwardian mans shoe, this is the Era in which the kilt and its components took their present life and style. Thus it is the Right Style of Male Footwear to wear with the Kilt. I liked them well enough to order another pair in Black, again. I had wanted the Brown, but it is out of stocklikely forever And yes, I HAVE recommended these to many friends; via a Kilt wearing Forum. For the trowser wearing men, these should look suitable half covered by the trowsers cuff, but then you hide most of the footwear, and its style. On 2nd thought, stay with the Oxford/low cut shoes when you wear trowsers!

Lined with glove leather is an especially nice touch. Made in Bangladesh, so it is not your usual Chinese product which is hit or miss. Bangladesh is adjacent to India, so the craftsmanship is much better. I always treat my boots with 50-50 boiled linseed oil and beeswax to preserve them and waterproof them. Noticed the leather although soft and supple absorbed this process and it took 6 treatments to finally seal them. Not a problem, but my process does darken the leather, which does not bother me as it protects my feet. Suspect that they must not oil these boots while they are in production, so if you buy them, you may want to use my treatment or simply put on the available mink oil, although that will darken the leather somewhat too.

I have feet that are borderline narrow, so finding boots that fit my feet comfortably with out being tightened all the way is a challenge.

The tongue has ample cushioning on the upper, and has stayed centered on my leg (other boots I have had the tongue tends to wander to the side).So far my only complaint has been where the laces transition from the foot to the ankle staying tighter while the toe and upper have been a little loose, and trying to balance that portion out.', 'Score': 1, 'user_data': {'dob': '1985-07-30 00:00:00', 'state': 'Vermont', 'age': 33, 'statecode': 'VT'}}, {'User': 'zxmr4442', 'Review': 'Update July 2015:Six months is usually the test on whether a pair of boots will cut it or need to be tossed.

There was an associate not more than 5 feet away who asked me if i was finding everything alright and when I asked if they had my size in this style in the back she immediately when to check for and when she returned she told me that she cold not find my size but that they could be ordered for me and would arrive in a couple of days.

And this description is ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE. I hate bootcut, & these are just barely so, without being the boring straight-cut that hangs on your legs like a sack! The waist band sits just below navel, & is a little work to pull up, but I think thats because the fabric is thick to begin with, & the band is obviously elasticized to hold up well - and hold it does, believe me - so these are pullon pants that dont look like pullon, stay put throughout the day while fitting close & slim.

COMPLETELY normal. And how satisfying that I could mend myself in such a delicious, holistic way. Second, not wanting to go without my daily morning constitutional smoothie, I decided to purchase a second blender for my summer home. Nutri Ninjas reviews were equally high and positive compared to the NutriBullet. So I bought the former, taking note of the higher wattage of the Ninjas motor. I returned the Ninja the next day.

Again, I ignored and bought anyway and sure enough......the gray is green. Sooo, I think Pennys has a misconception of the color gray and what its supposed to look like.

I understand where some of the reviews are saying it can erase the line if you go over it or that it dried out. I find its best if you store it upside down (I use the older Real techniques brushes stand for this) to keep lots of product in the tip. When there is more product on the tip I find it does less of the erasing if you go over the line again. I also found waiting a bit before correcting your line stops the erasing issue. You can correct it if you do it right away but once it sets you may need remover to fix it. Ive never tried to smudge it but it does last long...unless youre like me and forget you have makeup on and rub your eyes then it can flake a bit...otherwise long lasting.

Other than the dresser & chest of drawers backing which is wood composite, the set IS solid wood. Depending on how its treated, wood does scratch... its not a bar of gold after all. If you have this set, try alternating or flipping the drawer panels for leveling out any use over time!

The pluses are that it is very attractive and super quiet. The minuses are that Im not sure yet how much I like the SS interior. It is very dark to see inside. This seems to have really compromised the rinse agent compartment for which the holes are tiny, for one, to pour the rinse agent into and its impossible to read the labeling without getting really close. The biggest problem, however, is that the plastic peep hole that turns blue when filled is impossible to see in the dark interior. This design oversight is a nuisance and why I gave the machine 4 and not 5 stars. Finally, I ran the machine using the maximum settings due to the amount of dirty pots and pans and it took all evening. Its run time is much longer than any dishwasher Ive ever had before. Knowing these things I might have reconsidered the purchase.', 'Score': 2, 'user_data': {'dob': '1967-08-04 00:00:00', 'state': 'Mississippi', 'age': 51, 'statecode': 'MS'}}, {'User': 'bupj3112', 'Review': 'Got a very good deal on the pricing; machine is very quiet and easy to use.

I like the slight scoop, bottom, in the back. Nice length too. True to size (I wear medium, and have worn M in past years Stylus Ts as well. Medium, in these Ts, fits perfect!) The V neck is just right (not too high, not too deep). I ordered both light and dark colors (none are see through).

As a pet owner, I wanted something that looked good and was easy to clean; synthetic fibers are hard to stain. The backing on this rug is latex, which is washable and does not slip on the floor. I was also looking for a color scheme of blues, creams and muted greens and finally found it in the Blue Kartoum Rug. Best of all, it was on sale! I ordered a 5 x 8 area rug and a matching smaller one. When it arrived, I was somewhat dismayed that the brown was so prominent and the blue less so. In the photo, it appears to have a really wide blue border, but in the sizes I got, it is not as wide and the cream that edges the rug minimizes it more. As I liked the other features of the rug I decided to keep it for a few days and see if it grew on me-it did. Actually, the dark pattern is not all brown, but dark green with dark beige patterns intermixed. The blue band is more of a teal with green, off white and tan designs scattered throughout. Interestingly, there is also a paler, medium blue design interspersed on the off white background in the middle of the rug and that helps to balance the brown. It is really an interesting pattern and it will certain help to disguise any dirt. As for being easy care, one of my cats decided to christen it with its breakfast, I wiped it up and squirted some Res*lve type rug cleaner on it and pouf, it was gone! The rug can be washed in a washing machine if you have a smaller size or a professional sized washer. When mine needs it, I plan to drag it out on the deck, blast it with the hose and some soap, then hang it out to dry. Its not super thick so it should be easy to do. (The 5 x 8 weighs 15 lbs.) The weave is dense, and it is soft underfoot; the way the pattern blends smoothly together makes it looks like a much more expensive rug. However, if you want a super thick pile this will not be up to your standards, although you could get a pad to increase the thickness. All in all, I feel like this rug is quite a bargain!
