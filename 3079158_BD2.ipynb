    "|Grade|Requirement|\n",
    "|:---|:---|\n",
    "| Fail | You will fail if your code does not run or does not achieve even the basics of the task. You may also fail if you submit code without either comments or a text explanation of what the code does.|\n",
    "| Pass | To pass, you must submit sufficient working code to show that you have mastered the basics of the task, even if not everything works completely. You must include some justifications for your choice of methods, but without mentioning alternatives. |\n",
    "| Merit | For a merit, your code must be mostly correct, with only small problems or parts missing, and your comments must be useful rather than simply re-stating the code in English. Most choices for methods and structures should be explained and alternatives mentioned. |\n",
    "| Distinction | For a distinction, your code must be working, correct, and well commented and shows an appreciation of style, efficiency and reliability. All choices for methods and structures are concisely justified and alternatives are given well thought considerations. For a distinction, your work should be good enough to present to executives at the company.|\n",

    "When you are ready to submit, **print** your notebook as PDF (go to File -> Print Preview) in the Jupyter menu. Make sure you have run all the cells and that their output is displayed.

Consequently, the University seeks to promote and nurture academic integrity, support staff academic integrity, and support students to understand and develop good academic skills that facilitate academic integrity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Poor Academic Practice is defined as: \"The submission of any type of assessment with a lack of referencing or inadequate referencing which does not effectively acknowledge the origin of words, ideas, images, tables, diagrams, maps, code, sound and any other sources used in the assessment.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Academic Misconduct\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic Misconduct is defined as: \"any act or attempted act that does not demonstrate academic integrity and that may result in creating an unfair academic advantage for you or another person, or an academic disadvantage for any other member or member of the academic community.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Plagiarism is presenting somebody else’s work as your own **and includes the use of artificial intelligence tools beyond AIAS Level 2 or the use of Large Language Models.**. Plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct and is taken very seriously by the University. Students found to have plagiarised work can have marks deducted and, in serious cases, even be expelled from the University. Do not submit any work that is not entirely your own. Do not collaborate with or get help from anybody else with this assignment.\n",

    "Your task with this assignment is to use the data provided to demonstrate your Python data manipulation skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three `.csv` files and two `.json` files so you can process different types of data. The files also contain unstructured data in the form of natural language in English and links to images that you can access from the JC Penney website (use the field called `product_image_urls`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with easy tasks to show you can read in a file, create some variables and data structures, and manipulate their contents. Then move onto something more interesting.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You can add additional data if you need to - either download it or access it using `requests`. Produce working code to implement your ideas in as many cells as you need below. There is no single right answer, the aim is to simply show you are competent in using python for data analysis. Exactly how you do that is up to you.\n",

    "\n",
    " 1. **Business understanding** - What business context is the data coming from? What insights would be valuable in that context, and what data would be required for that purporse? \n",
    " 2. **Data understanding and preparation** - Explore the data and show you understand its structure and relations, with the aid of appropriate visualisation techniques. Assess the data quality, which insights you would be able to answer from it, and what preparation the data would require. Add new data from another source if required to bring new insights to the data you already have.\n",
    " 3. **Data modeling (optional)** - Would modeling be required for the insights you have considered? Use appropriate techniques, if so.\n",
    " 4. **Evaluation and deployment** - How do the insights you obtained help the company, and how can should they be adopted in their business? If modeling techniques have been adopted, are their use scientifically sound and how should they be mantained?"
